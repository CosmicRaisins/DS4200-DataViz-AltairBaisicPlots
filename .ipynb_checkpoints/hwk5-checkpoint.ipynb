The data was cleaned and the rate of increase was calculated from calculating the derivatives. Originally, I plotted the graph using the number of titles added at each year. This was alter changed because it did not generate a intuitive visulization, leading to increased processing time, and possible false conclusions. The data from 2020 was removed because the year has not passed in full. I chose a line chart for this visualization because it is commonly used to showcase trend.\n",
